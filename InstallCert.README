To download a cert, do:

javac InstallCert.java
java InstallCert <hostname>:<port>      # e.g. java InstallCert mail.dreamhost.com:993

This will save the cert in a file called jssecacerts.
You can then use this cert as the trust store by running

java -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=jssecacerts ImapDownloader <hostname> <port>
